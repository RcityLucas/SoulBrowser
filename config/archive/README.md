# Config Archive

Drop superseded configuration samples here (e.g., old gateway policies, bespoke
`.env` templates). When moving a file into this directory, document the
replacement or migration instructions so contributors know which active example
supersedes it.

The Project Slimming plan tracks this cleanup so the top-level `config/` folder
only contains live `.example` files and directories referenced by the current
Serve stack.
