# START_SERVER (Archived)

This guide is superseded by [`docs/guides/BACKEND_USAGE.md`](../guides/BACKEND_USAGE.md),
which consolidates backend bring-up, CLI/API examples, and troubleshooting steps
in one place. Refer to that document for the latest instructions.

Context:
- Original scope overlapped heavily with BACKEND_USAGE and the troubleshooting
  guide, so maintaining both led to stale snippets.
- Any environment-specific notes that remain relevant were merged into
  `BACKEND_USAGE.md` and `TROUBLESHOOTING.md`.
