The canonical troubleshooting checklist now lives in
[`docs/guides/TROUBLESHOOTING.md`](../guides/TROUBLESHOOTING.md). That guide
covers perception/Chrome failures, Task Center hiccups, and log collection, so
this older note has been retired to avoid duplicate instructions.

If you still need historical context from this file, grab it from git history.
All actionable steps have been merged into the main troubleshooting playbook.
