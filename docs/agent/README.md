# L8 Agent Docs (Legacy)

The detailed agent planning documents previously hosted here now live under
`docs/plans/ARCHIVE/`. These files remain available for historical context but
are no longer updated:

- `docs/plans/ARCHIVE/CDP_ACTION_PLAN.md`
- `docs/plans/ARCHIVE/PLAN_PERCEPTION_FIRST.md`
- `docs/plans/ARCHIVE/USER_NEED_EXECUTION_PLAN.md`
- `docs/plans/ARCHIVE/L8_STAGE1_PROGRESS.md`

For current Serve/API and slimming workstreams, follow the active plans in
`docs/plans/` (`serve_api_optimization.md`, `project_slimming.md`,
`flexible_parser_expansion.md`). Planner payload details now live in
`docs/reference/PLAN_SCHEMA.md` alongside other API references.
